# AI-ML-Internship-Task-3
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains the completion of Task 3 for the AI & ML Internship. The project focuses on performing deep Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on two distinct datasets to understand patterns, detect outliers, and identify key features for future machine learning predictions.

📁 Projects Overview
1. Netflix Movies and TV Shows Analysis
Objective: To analyze the content distribution, growth trends, and audience targeting of the Netflix library.

Key Techniques: Time-series distribution, Categorical count analysis, Outlier detection in release years.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

2. Iris Species Diversity Analysis
Objective: To explore the physical characteristics of Iris flowers and identify the most defining features for species classification.

Key Techniques: Bimodal distribution analysis, Feature correlation (Heatmaps), Multivariate analysis via Box plots.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

🛠️ Requirements & Tools
Environment: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: * pandas (Data manipulation)

numpy (Numerical operations)

matplotlib (Basic visualization)

seaborn (Advanced statistical visualization)

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Steps Applied
Following the internship guidelines, the following steps were performed for both datasets:

Numerical Distribution: Plotted histograms to understand data spread and skewness.

Categorical Analysis: Used count plots to visualize frequency across types and species.

Outlier Detection: Implemented Box plots to identify anomalies in the data.

Feature Correlation: Created Heatmaps to find strong relationships between variables (e.g., Petal Length vs. Petal Width).

Insight Generation: Documented observations for every visualization.

Feature Importance: Identified which variables are most critical for building prediction models.

💡 Key Insights
Netflix Dataset:
Content production surged after 2015, peaking around 2018-2019.

Movies dominate the platform, comprising over 70% of total titles.

Netflix primarily targets mature audiences (TV-MA).

Iris Dataset:
PetalLengthCm and PetalWidthCm are highly correlated and serve as the best predictors for species.

Iris-setosa is uniquely distinguishable from other species due to its significantly smaller petal size.

The dataset is perfectly balanced with 50 samples per species.

🚀 How to Run the Notebooks
Clone this repository: git clone <your-repo-link>

Open Google Colab.

Upload the .ipynb files and the corresponding .csv files (netflix_titles.csv and Iris.csv).

Run all cells to see the visualizations and analysis.
